Then both groups can be lit with a single light source . They have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble . # Tissue engineering # Nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue . Tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors . For example , bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds . Tissue engineering might replace today 's conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants . Advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension . Artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates. # Antimicrobial effects # Nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties . It has been shown that Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vitro . Nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs . Another example is Silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds . Antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry. # Immune response # Buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy/immune response by preventing mast cells ( which cause allergic response ) from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues , by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti-oxidant currently available , such as vitamin E . In February 2013 , University of Pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response ; which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future . This is done by using the protein CD47 , found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the SIRPa in macrophages ; preventing an immune response from being triggered . # Arthroscope # Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes , which are pencil-sized devices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the surgeries with smaller incisions . The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients . It is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair . # Diagnostic and medical devices # Nanotechnology-on-a-chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology . Magnetic nanoparticles , bound to a suitable antibody , are used to label specific molecules , structures or microorganisms . Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample . Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different-sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads . Nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures . *C-dots ( Cornell dots ) are the smallest silica-based nanoparticles with the size **62628;7509;10 scriptstyle x </math> is given and the cost function to be minimized , that can be any function of the data <math> scriptstyle x </math> and the network 's output , <math> scriptstyle f </math> . The cost function is dependent on the task ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a priori ' ' assumptions ( the implicit properties of our model , its parameters and the observed variables ) . As a trivial example , consider the model <math> scriptstyle f(x) = a </math> where <math> scriptstyle a </math> is a constant and the cost <math> scriptstyle C=E ( x - f(x)2 </math> . Minimizing this cost will give us a value of <math> scriptstyle a </math> that is equal to the mean of the data . The cost function can be much more complicated . Its form depends on the application : for example , in compression it could be related to the mutual information between <math> scriptstyle x </math> and <math> scriptstyle f(x) </math> , whereas in statistical modeling , it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data . ( Note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized ) . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems ; the applications include clustering , the estimation of statistical distributions , compression and filtering . # #Reinforcement learning# # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually not given , but generated by an agent 's interactions with the environment . At each point in time <math> scriptstyle t </math> , the agent performs an action <math> scriptstyle yt </math> and the environment generates an observation <math> scriptstyle xt </math> and an instantaneous cost <math> scriptstyle ct </math> , according to some ( usually unknown ) dynamics . The aim is to discover a ' ' policy ' ' for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost ; i.e. , the expected cumulative cost . The environment 's dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown , but can be estimated . More formally the environment is modelled as a Markov decision process ( MDP ) with states <math> scriptstyle s1 , ... , snin S </math> and actions <math> scriptstyle a1 , ... , am in A </math> with the following probability distributions : the instantaneous cost distribution <math> scriptstyle P(ctst) </math> , the observation distribution <math> scriptstyle P(xtst) </math> and the transition <math> scriptstyle P ( st+1st , at ) </math> , while a policy is defined as conditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two then define a Markov chain ( MC ) . The aim is to discover the policy that minimizes the cost ; i.e. , the MC for which the cost is minimal . ANNs are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm . Dynamic programming has been coupled with ANNs ( Neuro dynamic programming ) by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing , natural resources management or medicine because of the ability of ANNs to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems , games and other sequential decision making tasks . # Learning algorithms # Training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models ( or , in a Bayesian framework , determining a distribution over the set of allowed models ) that minimizes the cost criterion . There are numerous algorithms available for training neural network models ; most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statistical estimation . Most of the algorithms used in training artificial neural networks employ some form of gradient descent . This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction . Evolutionary methods , These networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer . The diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient . The models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables . Colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks . Neural networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with more accuracy than the current clinical methods . After training , the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions . # Neural networks and neuroscience # Theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems . Since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behavior , the field is closely related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work . To gain this understanding , neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes ( data ) , biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning ( biological neural network models ) and theory ( statistical learning theory and information theory ) . # #Types of models# # Many models are used in the field , defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems . They range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons , models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems . These include models of the long-term , and short-term plasticity , of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level . # Neural network software # Neural network software is used to simulate , research , develop and apply artificial neural networks , biological neural networks and , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Types of artificial neural networks # Artificial neural network types vary from those with only one or two layers of single direction logic , to complicated multiinput many directional feedback loops and layers . On the whole , these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of their functions . Most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying connections to the neurons . Artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from outside teachers or even self-teaching from written-in rules . # Theoretical properties # # Computational power # The multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) is a universal function approximator , as proven by the Cybenko theorem . However , the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of the weights . Work by Hava Siegelmann and Eduardo D. Sontag has provided a proof that a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights ( as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights ) has the full power of a Universal Turing Machine to detecting credit card fraud . Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , for instance , are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven , ( what has n't ? ) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked : the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque , unreadable table ... valueless as a scientific resource . In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology , Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers . An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having . # In response to this kind of criticism , one should note that although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult , it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network . Furthermore , researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 ) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning , as well as shallow vs deep architecture . Some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models ( combining neural networks and symbolic approaches ) . They advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind ( Sun and Bookman , 1990 ) . **22;70143;gallery **25;70167;TOOLONG single-layer feedforward artificial neural network .
