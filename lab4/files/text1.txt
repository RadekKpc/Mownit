The latitude of the city that would become Aswan located at 24 5 23 was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers . They believed that it was seated immediately under the tropic , and that on the day of the summer solstice , a vertical staff cast no shadow . They noted that the sun 's disc was reflected in a well at noon . This statement is only approximately correct ; at the summer solstice , the shadow was only <sup> 1 </sup> / <sub> 400 </sub> th of the staff , and so could scarcely be discerned , and the northern limb of the Sun 's disc would be nearly vertical . However , Eratosthenes used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at Alexandria to perform the first known calculation of the circumference of the Earth . The Nile is nearly 2.7 m wide above Aswan . From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt , the river flows for more than without bar or cataract .

@@4514 Genetically modified maize ( corn ) is a genetically modified crop . Specific maize strains have been genetically engineered to express agriculturally-desirable traits , including resistance to pests and to herbicides . Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries . GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects , impact on other insects and impact on other plants via gene flow . One strain , called Starlink , was approved only for animal feed in the US , but was found in food , leading to a series of recalls starting in 2000. # Marketed Products # # Herbicide resistant maize # Corn varieties resistant to glyphosate herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto , and are known as Roundup Ready Corn .
