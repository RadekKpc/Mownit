common history . As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians ( 26.9% in Latvia and 25.5% in Estonia ) , some of whom are non-citizens . Latvia is historically predominantly Protestant Lutheran , except for the Latgale region in the southeast , which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic . The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918 . However , its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II . In 1940 , the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union , invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and re-occupied by the Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation of Soviet rule . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Latvia declared the restoration of its de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a member of NATO , European Union , United Nations , Council of Europe , CBSS , IMF , NB8 , NIB , OSCE , and WTO . It is currently in the accession process for joining the OECD . For 2013 , Latvia is listed 44th on the Human Development Index and as a high income country . It used the Latvian lats as its currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014. # Etymology # The name ' ' Latvija ' ' is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians , one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes ( along with Couronians , Selonians and Semigallians ) , which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians. # History # Around 3000 BCE , the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea . The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium , trading local amber for precious metals . By 900 CE , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selonians , Semigallians ( in Latvian : ' ' kuri ' ' , ' ' latgai ' ' , ' ' si ' ' and ' ' zemgai ' ' ) , as well as the Livonians ( ' ' lbiei ' ' ) speaking a Finnic language . # The Medieval period # Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries , they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century . The first missionaries , sent by the Pope , sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century , seeking converts . The local people , however , did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped . German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms . In the beginning of the 13th century , large parts of today 's Latvia were ruled by Germans . Together with Southern Estonia , these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia . In 1282 , Riga , and later the cities of Csis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanseatic League . and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe . # The Reformation period # The 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of Latvia , including the reformation , the collapse of the Livonian state , and the time when the Latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers . After the Livonian War ( 15581583 ) , Livonia ( Latvia ) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule . The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the ' ' Ducatus Ultradunensis ' ' ( Prdaugavas hercogiste ) . Gotthard Kettler , the last Master of the Order of Livonia , formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia . Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland , it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century . Latgalia , the easternmost region of Latvia , became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty . The 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern Baltic . After the PolishSwedish War ( 16001611 ) , northern Livonia ( including Vidzeme ) came under Swedish rule . Riga became the capital of Swedish Livonia and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire . Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629 . In Latvia , the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive ; serfdom was eased , a network of schools was established for the peasantry , and the power of the regional barons was diminished . Several important cultural changes occurred during this time . Under Swedish and largely German rule , western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion . The ancient tribes of the Couronians , Semigallians , Selonians , Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people , speaking one Latvian language . Throughout all the centuries , however , no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective . Meanwhile , largely isolated from the rest of Latvia , southern Latgallians adopted Catholicism under Polish/Jesuit influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Polish and Russian loanwords. # Latvia in the Russian Empire ( 17101917 ) # The Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad , ending the Great Northern War in 1721 , gave Vidzeme to Russia ( it became part of the Governorate of Livonia During the Great Northern War ( 17001721 ) , up to 40 per cent of Latvians died from famine and plague . Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 17101711 . The promises Peter the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of Riga in 1710 , confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad and known as the Capitulations , largely reversed the Swedish reforms . Peter seriously considered moving Russian capital into Riga and visited Riga for several long stays ( he stayed in his own palace offered as a gift by Riga Magistrate together with keys from Riga ; palace purchased by him is still standing ; keys are exhibited in Moscow Kremlin museum ) .

In practice , however , the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility , as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation , forcing them to return to work at the estates of their own free will . During the 19th century , the social structure changed dramatically . A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land , but many landless peasants remained . There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie . The Young Latvian ( ) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century , many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order . The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening . Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863 : this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s .

Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution , which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces . During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom ports were expanded ( Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire ) , railways built ; new factories , banks and University were established ; many residential , public ( theatres and museums ) and school buildings erected ; new parks formed ; etc . Riga 's boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the Old Town date from this period . # Declaration of Independence # World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of Latvia , including other western parts of the Russian Empire . Demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy , but the Russian 1917 Revolution , treaty with Germany at Brest-Litovsk , and allied armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 , created a power vacuum . The People 's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on 18 November 1918 , with Krlis Ulmanis becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe . By the spring of 1919 , there were actually three governmentsUlmanis 's government ; the Latvian Soviet government led by Pteris Stuka , whose forces , supported by the Red Army , occupied almost all of the country ; and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic Duchy , headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit ' ' Iron Division ' ' . Estonian and Latvian forces A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on 1 May 1920 , and adopted a liberal constitution , the ' ' Satversme ' ' , in February 1922 . The constitution was partly suspended by Krlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990 . Since then , it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today . With most of Latvia 's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915 , radical land reform was the central political question for the young state . In 1897 , 61.2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that percentage had been reduced to 18% . By 1923 , the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level . Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy , but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression . Latvia showed signs of economic recovery , and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period . On 15 May 1934 , Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup , establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940 . After 1934 , Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of Latvianising the economy . # Latvia in World War II # Early in the morning of 24 August 1939 , the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact , called the MolotovRibbentrop Pact . The pact contained a secret protocol , revealed only after Germany 's defeat in 1945 , according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet spheres of influence . In the North , Latvia , Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective portions of Poland . After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis ' government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich programme . In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939 , with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia . Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940 , when a second resettlement On 5 October 1939 , Latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union , granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory . After staging border incidents , on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow a note , in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 , and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government . The Latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force . On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Latvian territory . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning . This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government , which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union .

I shall remain in my place , you remain in yours . # No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces ; on the contrary , part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm , which was heavily exploited by Soviet propaganda .
