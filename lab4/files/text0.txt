@@1514 Albert of Prussia ( 17 May 1490 20 March 1568 ) was the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights , who after converting to Lutheranism , became the first monarch of the Duchy of Prussia , the secularized state that emerged from the former Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights . Albert was the first European ruler to establish Protestantism as the official state religion of his lands . He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage , ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades ( 15101568 ) . A member of the Brandenburg-Ansbach branch of the House of Hohenzollern , Albert 's election as Grand Master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the Teutonic Knights . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and did indeed reverse the decline of the Teutonic Order . However , Albert , who was sympathetic to the demands of Martin Luther , rebelled against the Catholic church , and the Holy Roman Empire by converting the Teutonic state into a Protestant and hereditary realm , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle , the King of Poland .

Albert 's rule in Prussia was fairly prosperous . Although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the Catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established Prussian court . He was active in imperial politics , joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . Albert established schools in every town and founded Knigsberg University in 1544 . He promoted culture and arts , patronising the works of Erasmus Reinhold and Caspar Hennenberger .

Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . His son Albert Frederick succeeded him as Duke of Prussia . Albert 's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern . He is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . # Early life # Albert was born in Ansbach in Franconia as the third son of Frederick I , Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach . His mother was Sophia , daughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , and his wife Elisabeth of Austria . He was raised for a career in the Church and spent some time at the court of Hermann IV of Hesse , Elector of Cologne , who appointed him canon of the Cologne Cathedral . Despite being quite religious , he was also interested in mathematics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories . His career was forwarded by the Church however and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advance . Turning to a more active life , Albert accompanied Emperor Maximilian I to Italy in 1508 , and after his return spent some time in the Kingdom of Hungary . # Grand Master # Duke Frederick of Saxony , Grand Master of the Teutonic Order , died in December 1510 . Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle , Sigismund I the Old , Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland , would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia , which had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Thorn ( 1466 ) . The new Grand Master , aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy , refused to submit to the crown of Poland . As war over the Order 's existence appeared inevitable , Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland , culminated in a war which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia . Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521 . The dispute was referred to Emperor Charles V and other princes , but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war . For this purpose he visited the Diet of Nuremberg in 1522 , where he made the acquaintance of the Reformer Andreas Osiander , by whose influence Albert was won over to Protestantism . The Grand Master then journeyed to Wittenberg , where he was advised by Martin Luther to abandon the rules of his Order , to marry , and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself . This proposal , which was understandably appealing to Albert , had already been discussed by some of his relatives ; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously , and he assured Pope Adrian VI that he was anxious to reform the Order and punish the knights who had adopted Lutheran doctrines . Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians , while Albert 's brother , Margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach , laid the scheme before their uncle , Sigismund I the Old of Poland . # Duke in Prussia # After some delay Sigismund assented to the offer , with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom ; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at Krakw , Albert pledged a personal oath to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525 . The Estates of the land then met at Knigsberg ( Kaliningrad ) and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke , who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther . This transition did not , however , take place without protest . Summoned before the imperial court of justice , Albert refused to appear and was proscribed , while the Order elected a new Grand Master , Walter von Cronberg , who received Prussia as a fief at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing the tumult of the Reformation , the German Peasants ' War , and the wars against the Ottoman Turks , they did not enforce the ban on the duke , and agitation against him soon died away . In imperial politics Albert was fairly active . Joining the League of Torgau in 1526 , he acted in unison with the Protestants , and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the Augsburg Interim in May 1548 . For various reasons , however , poverty and personal inclination among others , he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period . The early years of Albert 's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous . Although he had some trouble with the peasantry , the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court . He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life .

Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical Prutenic Tables compiled by Erasmus Reinhold and the first maps of Prussia by Caspar Hennenberger . This step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert 's reign . Osiander 's divergence from Luther 's doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with Philip Melanchthon , who had adherents in Knigsberg , and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town . The duke strenuously supported Osiander , and the area of the quarrel soon broadened . There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles , the burden of taxation was heavy , and Albert 's rule became unpopular . After Osiander 's death in 1552 , Albert favoured a preacher named Johann Funck , who , with an adventurer named Paul Skali , exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense . The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should that happen , to appoint a regent , as his only son , Albert Frederick was still a mere youth . The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander , and the climax came in 1566 when the Estates appealed to King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland , Albert 's cousin , who sent a commission to Knigsberg . Skali saved his life by flight , but Funck was executed . The question of the regency was settled , and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers . Virtually deprived of power , the duke lived for two more years , and died at Tapiau on 20 March 1568 . Cornelis Floris de Vriendt designed his tomb within Knigsberg Cathedral . Albert was a voluminous letter writer , and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time . # Legacy # Although Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history , his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia , which would eventually become arguably the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation , and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of Germany . He was a skilled political administrator and leader , and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order , until he betrayed it by transforming the order 's lands into his own duchy , secularizing it in the process . Albert was the first German noble to support Luther 's ideas and in 1544 founded the University of Knigsberg , the Albertina , as a rival to the Roman Catholic Cracow Academy . It was the second Lutheran university in the German states , after the University of Marburg . A relief of Albert over the Renaissance-era portal of Knigsberg Castle 's southern wing was created by Andreas Hess in 1551 according to plans by Christoph Rmer . Another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the Albertina 's original campus .

On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at Knigsberg Castle with the inscription : Albert of Brandenburg , Last Grand Master , First Duke in Prussia . Albert Wolff also designed an equestrian statue of Albert located at the new campus of the Albertina . King 's Gate contains a statue of Albert . Albert was oft-honored in the quarter Maraunenhof in northern Knigsberg . Its main street was named Herzog-Albrecht-Allee in 1906 .
