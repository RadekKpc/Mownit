To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region ( ' ' ' ' ) and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority . The area lost its administrative county status in 1994 , with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ' ' Local Government ( Dublin ) Act , 1993 ' ' stating that the county shall cease to exist . At that time , and in response to a European Council report highlighting Ireland as the most centralised country in the European Union , it was decided that a single County Dublin was unmanageable and undemocratic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve Dublin County Council , Avril Doyle TD said , The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin , and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin .

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region , the term County Dublin is still in common usage . Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a County Dublin or Dublin Region basis . The area formerly known as County Dublin is now defined in legislation solely as the Dublin Region under the ' ' Local Government Act , 1991 ( Regional Authorities ) ( Establishment ) Order , 1993 ' ' , and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area .
