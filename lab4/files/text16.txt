platform technology , the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects . *Researchers at The Methodist Hospital Research Institute in Houston have created ' LeukoLike Vectors ' or LLVs . LLVs are the drug-carrying silicon nanoparticles coated with the lipoprotein removed from the membranes of the white blood cells , leukocytes . The ' cloaked ' nanoparticles were found to behave like leukocytes , are able to evade the body 's immune system and survive much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scientists expressed that LLVs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by avoiding clearance in blood stream , crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissues due to its leukocyte like characters . Synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte. *Inhalable nanocarriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system ( NLCS ) . The lipid nanoparticles contain the drug payload ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) ; two types of small interfering RNA ( siRNA , targeted the BCL-2 mRNA to suppress nonpump cellular resistance , and MRP1 mRNA to suppress pump drug resistance ) ; and the targeting molecules , an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) which homes in the overexpressed receptors of the cancer cells . The disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer . Results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment . *Self-powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion gradients generated by leaked minerals ( ions ) from the bone , and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing . Using a model system of human tibia and femur , researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Boston University used nanoparticles of polylactic-coglycolic acid ( widely used in medical devices ) carrying sodium alendronate ( an osteoporosis drug ) for the ' ' in vitro ' ' experiments and found the ' nanotrucks ' successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone . *Nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule . Clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50-100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload . Experiments by researchers in Northwestern University on mouse models with chemotherapy-resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone . The nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , once inside the tumor , the nanoparticles are retained much longer . Additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple-negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin . Increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models . UCLA reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine . The nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears . The drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down . *In regenerative medicine research , silica based nanoparticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells . Using a mouse model , scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant ' ' in vivo ' ' . *Nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model . Researchers in the North Carolina State University designed this nanoparticle , called Gelipo , to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both . The cross-linked hyaluronic acid ( HA ) shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide . HA preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase ( HAase ) rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes . When the HAase degrades the gel shell of Gelipo , the TRAIL protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis ( cell death ) . The core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes , the cellular transport system . The peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly , maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects . # Protein and peptide delivery # Protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders . These macromolecules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and Dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics , and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals. # #Applications and reported research studies# # *Nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis . Biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse 's immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system . Team of researchers in Northwestern University indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases . *Researchers at UCLA developed a nanoparticle system with water-soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus , apoptin . Apoptin selectively sends self-destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) as it builds up in the nucleus , while leaving healthy cells unharmed . In the mouse model of human breast cancer , the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth . This new form of treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming healthy cells , a common pitfall of chemotherapy , and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy . *A nano-network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin , modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with Type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days . The nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan ( from shrimp shells ) or negatively charged alginate ( from seaweed ) . The opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano-network even after they are injected subcutaneously . The porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores . When there is high blood sugar level , glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid . The disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range . # Cancer # The small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology , particularly in imaging . Quantum dots ( nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , can produce exceptional images of tumor sites . These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation . This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today 's organic dyes used as contrast media . The downside , however , is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements . Another nanoproperty , high surface area to volume ratio , allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle , which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells . Additionally , the small size of nanoparticles ( 10 to 100 nanometers ) , allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites ( because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system ) . Research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect , image , and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way . A promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials . Kanzius RF therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the body with radio waves that heat only the nanoparticles and the adjacent ( cancerous ) cells . Sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires , able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells , could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient 's blood . The basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts : a ) efficient encapsulation of the drugs , b ) successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body , and c ) successful release of that drug there . Researchers at Rice University under Prof. Jennifer West , have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice . The nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface . By irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser , which passes through flesh without heating it , the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells . Limitations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lack of solubility . Nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems . Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide ( quantum dots ) glow when exposed to ultraviolet light . When injected , they seep into cancer tumors . The surgeon can see the glowing tumor , and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal . In photodynamic therapy , a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside . The light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal , energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue . Light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them ( like tumors ) . This therapy is appealing for many reasons . It does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body ( chemotherapy ) because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist . Photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases , growth and tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform , by targeting specific tumor cells , tissues and organs . Actually , Conde et al . reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic siRNA silencing via RGD-nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model . This study reported the use of siRNA/RGD gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models , resulting in successful and significant ' ' c-Myc ' ' oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals . This delivery system can achieve translocation of siRNA duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression . Actually , RGD/siRNA-AuNPs can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3-receptor-mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity , showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered ' ' c-Myc ' ' siRNA to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis. # Surgery # At Rice University , a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece . The two pieces of chicken are placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribbled along the seam . An infrared laser is traced along the seam , causing the two sides to weld together . This could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant . The flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly . # Visualization # Tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized . It is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body , so scientists used to dye the cells . These dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up . While different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light , there was a need for as many light sources as cells . A way around this problem is with luminescent tags . These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes . The dots
