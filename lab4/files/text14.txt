@@21514 Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology . Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials , to nanoelectronic biosensors , and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology . Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials ( materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers , i.e. billionths of a meter ) . Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health . Of note is the funding in 2005 of a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers . In April 2006 , the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide . # Overview # The biological and medical research communities have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications ( e.g. , contrast agents for cell imaging and therapeutics for treating cancer ) . Terms such as ' ' biomedical nanotechnology ' ' , ' ' nanobiotechnology ' ' , and ' ' nanomedicine ' ' are used to describe this hybrid field .

Thus far , the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices , contrast agents , analytical tools , physical therapy applications , and drug delivery vehicles . Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future . The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems , new therapies , and in vivo imaging . Neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research . Further down the line , the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field . Nanomedicine is a large industry , with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004 , and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide , a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&amp;D is being invested every year .
