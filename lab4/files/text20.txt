some sleep disorders , including hallucinations in narcolepsy ( in which REM sleep intrudes into wakefulness ) Psychosis can even be caused by familiar ailments such as flu or mumps. # Psychoactive drugs # Various psychoactive substances ( both legal and illegal ) have been implicated in causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users . This may be upon intoxication , for a more prolonged period after use , or upon withdrawal . Individuals who have a substance induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness . Drugs that can induce psychotic symptoms include cannabis , cocaine , amphetamines , cathinones , psychedelic drugs ( such as LSD and psilocybin ) , -opioid receptor agonists ( such as enadoline and salvinorin A ) and NMDA receptor antagonists ( such as phencyclidine and ketamine ) . # #Alcohol# # Approximately three percent of people who are suffering from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal . Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism . The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes , gene expression , as well as thiamin deficiency . It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder , i.e. schizophrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments . # #Cannabis# # According to some studies , the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness , with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia . While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by some , it remains controversial , with pre-existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis . Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis , tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) and cannabidiol ( CBD ) , have opposite effects with respect to psychosis . While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals , CBD may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis . Cannabis use has increased dramatically over the past few decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased . Together , these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis . High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals , and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged . # #Methamphetamine# # Methamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26-46 percent of heavy users . Some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months . Those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine . Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine. # Medication # Administration , or sometimes withdrawal , of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms . Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally and/or in a significant proportion of patients include amphetamine and other sympathomimetics , dopamine agonists , ketamine , corticosteroids ( often with mood changes in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # A 2014 study found no evidence that familial risk accounts for associations between childhood physical abuse and psychotic disorder , or that it substantially increases the odds of psychosis among individuals reporting abuse . # Diagnosis # Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have demonstrated that structural and functional MRI can detect changes in the brain that precede the onset of diagnosis and could potentially be used as a diagnostic aid . # Pathophysiology # The first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography ( a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X-ray picture ) . The purpose of the brain is to collect information from the body ( pain , hunger , etc. ) , and from the outside world , interpret it to a coherent world view , and produce a meaningful response . The information from the senses enter the brain in the primary sensory areas . They process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information is interpreted . Spontaneous activity in the primary sensory areas may produce hallucinations , which the secondary areas misinterpret as information from the real world . For example , a PET or fMRI scan of a person who claims he hears voices may show activation in the primary auditory cortex , or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech . Tertiary brain cortex collects the interpretations from the secondary cortexes and creates a coherent world view of it . A study investigating structural changes in the brains of people with psychosis showed there was significant grey matter reduction in the right medial temporal , lateral temporal , and inferior frontal gyrus , and in the cingulate cortex bilaterally of people before and after they became psychotic . Findings such as these have led to debate about whether psychosis itself causes excitotoxic brain damage and whether potentially damaging changes to the brain are related to the length of psychotic episode . Recent research has suggested that this is not the case although further investigation is still ongoing . Studies with sensory deprivation have shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function properly . If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses , loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours . A similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly , when poor eyesight , hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment . On the other hand , loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses . The 5-HT2A receptor seems to be important for this , since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations . However , the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations , but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli . Close relatives to psychotic patients may hear voices , but since they are aware that they are unreal they can ignore them , so that the hallucinations do not affect their reality perception . Hence they are not considered psychotic . Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine . In particular , the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brain , particularly in the mesolimbic pathway . The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs ( i.e. , antipsychotics ) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms , and that drugs that boost dopamine activity ( such as amphetamines and cocaine ) can trigger psychosis in some people ( see amphetamine psychosis ) . However , increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate , in particular , with the activity of the NMDA receptor . This theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine , PCP and dextromethorphan ( at large overdoses ) induce a psychotic state more readily than dopaminergic stimulants , even at normal recreational doses . The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia , including negative psychotic symptoms , more closely than amphetamine psychosis . Dissociative induced psychosis happens on a more reliable and predictable basis than amphetamine psychosis , which usually only occurs in cases of overdose , prolonged use or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New antipsychotic drugs that act on glutamate and its receptors are currently undergoing clinical trials . The connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed complex . While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity , the D1 receptor increases it . If D2-blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors . The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell , which takes time . Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis . Moreover , newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors , suggesting the ' dopamine hypothesis ' may be oversimplified . Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and Zoldan et al . reported moderately successful use of ondansetron , a 5-HT <sub> 3 </sub> receptor antagonist , in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson 's disease patients . Psychiatrist David Healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known important influences in the aetiology of psychosis . Some theories believe many psychotic symptoms are a problem with the perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences . For example , the hallucination of hearing voices may arise from internally generated speech that is mislabeled by the psychotic person as coming from an external source . It has been suggested that persons with bipolar disorder may have increased activity of the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere of the brain , while persons with schizophrenia have increased activity in the right hemisphere . Increased level of right hemisphere activation has also been found in people who have high levels of paranormal beliefs and in people who report mystical experiences . It also seems that people who are more creative are also more likely to show a similar pattern of brain activation . Some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal , mystical or creative experiences are in any way ' ' by themselves ' ' a symptom of mental illness , as it is still not clear what makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # In otherwise normal individuals , exogenous ligands can produce psychotic symptoms . NMDA receptor antagonists , such as ketamine , can produce a similar psychosis to that experienced in schizophrenia . Prolonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning , making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder . NMDA antagonists replicate some of the so-called negative symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses ( doses insufficient to induce anesthesia ) , and catatonia in high doses . Psychostimulants , especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking , can cause some positive symptoms , such as delusional beliefs , particularly those persecutory in nature . # Diagnosis # Psychosis is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion . So a new-onset episode of psychosis ' ' can not ' ' be considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded , or ruled out . Many clinicians improperly perform , or entirely miss this step , introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis . An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant . Biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use , medication , toxins , surgical complications , or other medical illnesses . Delirium should be ruled out , which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations , acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness , indicating other underlying factors , including medical illnesses . Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure : * Thyroid-stimulating hormone to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism , * Basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance , * Full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease , and * Serology to exclude syphilis or HIV infection . Other investigations include : * EEG to exclude epilepsy , and an * MRI or CT scan of the head to exclude brain lesions . Because psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications , such as antidepressants , ADHD stimulant medications , and sleep medications , medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out , particularly for first-episode psychosis .
