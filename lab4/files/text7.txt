The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec , and their beliefs have survived and evolved , combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists . The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements .

The ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature . # Renaissance to Romanticism ( 1500 to 1840 ) # One of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet 's murdered father in Shakespeares ' ' The Tragical History of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark ' ' . In ' ' Hamlet ' ' , it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his murder most foul and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle , King Claudius . In Shakespeares ' ' Macbeth ' ' , the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character . In English Renaissance theater , ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor , as with the ghost of Hamlets father . Armor , being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance , gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity . But the sheeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness : it clanked and creaked , and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators . These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichd stage elements . Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass , in ' ' Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory ' ' , point out , In fact , it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of ' spirit drapery ' . An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly the Border Ballads of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland . Ballads of this type include ' ' The Unquiet Grave ' ' , ' ' The Wife of Usher 's Well ' ' , and ' ' Sweet William 's Ghost ' ' , which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children . In the ballad ' ' King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed . The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman . One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was ' ' The Castle of Otranto ' ' by Horace Walpole in 1764 . Washington Irving 's short story ' ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ' ' ( 1820 ) , based on an earlier German folktale , features a Headless Horseman . It has been adapted for film and television many times , such as ' ' Sleepy Hollow ' ' , a successful 1999 feature film . # Victorian/Edwardian ( 1840 to 1920 ) # The classic ghost story arose during the Victorian period , and included authors such as M. R. James , Sheridan Le Fanu , Violet Hunt , and Henry James . Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition , and contain elements of folklore and psychology . M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as , Malevolence and terror , the glare of evil faces , the stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ' long-drawn , distant screams ' , are all in place , and so is a modicum of blood , shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded ... . Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of ' ' A Christmas Carol ' ' , in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley , and the ghosts of Christmas Past , Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come . Oscar Wilde 's comedy ' ' The Canterville Ghost ' ' has been adapted for film and television on several occasions . Henry James 's ' ' The Turn of the Screw ' ' has also appeared in a number of adaptations , notably the film ' ' The Innocents ' ' and Benjamin Britten 's opera ' ' The Turn of the Screw ' ' . Oscar Telgmann 's opera ' ' Leo , the Royal Cadet ' ' ( 1885 ) includes ' ' Judge 's Song ' ' about a ghost at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston , Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things ' ' is a 1904 collection of Japanese ghost stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn , and later made into a film . In the United States , prior to and during the First World War , folklorists Olive Dame Campbell and Cecil Sharp collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains , which included ghostly themes such as ' ' The Wife of Usher 's Well ' ' , ' ' The Suffolk Miracle ' ' , ' ' The Unquiet Grave ' ' , and ' ' The Cruel Ship 's Carpenter ' ' . The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover . These songs were variants of traditional British ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region . # Modern Era ( 1920 to 1970 ) # Professional parapsychologists and ghosts hunters , such as Harry Price , active in the 1920s and 1930s , and Peter Underwood , active in the 1940s and 1950s , published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price 's ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' ' Ghosts of Borley ' ' ( both recounting experiences at Borley Rectory ) . The writer Frank Edwards delved into ghost stories in his books of his , like Stranger than Science . Childrens benevolent ghost stories became popular , such as Casper the Friendly Ghost , created in the 1930s and appearing in comics , animated cartoons , and eventually a 1995 feature film . Nol Coward 's play ' ' Blithe Spirit ' ' , later made into a film , places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations . With the advent of motion pictures and television , screen depictions of ghosts became common , and spanned a variety of genres ; the works of Shakespeare , Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions . Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema , although that of ' ' The Haunting of Hill House ' ' to ' ' The Haunting ' ' in 1963 is an exception . Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror , and include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' , which was later adapted to television with a successful 196870 TV series . Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944 's ' ' The Uninvited ' ' , and 1945 's ' ' Dead of Night ' ' . # Post-modern ( 1970present ) # The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror . A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger , often with unfinished business , such as 1989 's ' ' Field of Dreams ' ' , the 1990 film ' ' Ghost ' ' , and the 1993 comedy ' ' Heart and Souls ' ' . In the horror genre , 1980 's ' ' The Fog ' ' , and the ' ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' ' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence .

The ghost hunting theme has been featured in reality television series , such as ' ' Ghost Adventures ' ' , ' ' Ghost Hunters ' ' , ' ' Ghost Hunters International ' ' , ' ' Ghost Lab ' ' , ' ' Most Haunted ' ' and ' ' A Haunting ' ' . It is also represented in children 's television by such programs as ' ' The Ghost Hunter ' ' and ' ' Ghost Trackers ' ' . Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations , and ghost hunting how-to manuals . The 1990s saw a return to classic gothic ghosts , whose dangers were more psychological than physical . Examples of films from this period include 1999 's ' ' The Sixth Sense ' ' and ' ' The Others ' ' .

G. Jung . Nick Harkaway considered that we all carry a host of ghosts in our heads , in the form of impressions of past acquaintances ghosts that represent our maps of other people in the world : our reference points . Object relations theory sees our personalities as formed by splitting off aspects of ourselves we find incompatible ; whereupon we may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of our alternate selves .
