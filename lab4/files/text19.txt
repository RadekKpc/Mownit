Bernard Bresslaw , Howard Lew Lewis , Brad Garrett and Rosey Grier voiced him in English dubs of cartoons . # Name # Obelix 's name is a pun on the French word ' ' oblisque ' ' ( obelisk ) , suggested by rotund physique and his habit of casually carrying heavy stone monuments ( Menhir ) around with him . In fact obelisk is also ( in both French and English ) a variant of the word obelus ( ' ' oble ' ' ) , a typographical mark ( ) often found in a companion role to that of the asterisk , after which his friend Asterix is named . 
@@24514 MedlinePlus = 001553 Psychosis ( from the Greek ' ' psyche ' ' , mind/soul , and - ' ' -osis ' ' , abnormal condition or derangement ) refers to an abnormal condition of the mind , and is a generic psychiatric term for a mental state often described as involving a loss of contact with reality . People suffering from psychosis are described as ' ' psychotic . ' ' Psychosis ( as a sign of a psychiatric disorder ) is a diagnosis of exclusion . That is , a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded . Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries , diseases and injuries of other organs , psychoactive substances , toxins , and prescribed medications as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed . In medical training , psychosis as a sign of illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and catatonic expressions of schizophrenia and bipolar type 1 disorder . In properly diagnosed psychiatric disorders ( where other causes have been excluded by extensive medical and biological laboratory tests ) , psychosis is a descriptive term for the hallucinations , delusions , sometimes violence , and impaired insight that may occur . Psychosis is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior ( negative signs ) and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs ( e.g. grandiosity , delusions of persecution ) . An excess in dopaminergic signalling is hypothesized to be linked to the Symptom#Positive and negative symptoms Many antipsychotic drugs accordingly target the dopamine system ; however , meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs show either no significant difference in effects between drug and placebo , or a moderate effect size , suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system . People experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and thought disorder . Depending on its severity , this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out daily life activities . # Signs and symptoms # People with psychosis may have one or more of the following : hallucinations , delusions , catatonia , or a thought disorder , as described below . Impairments in social cognition also occur . # Hallucinations # A hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli . Hallucinations are different from illusions , or perceptual distortions , which are the misperception of external stimuli . Hallucinations may occur in any of the five senses and take on almost any form , which may include simple sensations ( such as lights , colors , tastes , and smells ) to experiences such as seeing and interacting with fully formed animals and people , hearing voices , and having complex tactile sensations . Auditory hallucinations , particularly experiences of hearing voices , are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis . Hallucinated voices may talk about , or to , the person , and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities . Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory , commanding or preoccupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be a negative one . One research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help . The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers , regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental illness or not . # Delusions # Psychosis may involve delusional beliefs , some of which are paranoid in nature . Put simply , delusions are false beliefs that a person holds on to , without adequate evidence . It can be difficult to change the belief , even with evidence to the contrary . Common themes of delusions are persecutory ( person believes that others are out to harm him/her ) , grandiose ( person believing that he or she has special powers or skills ) , etc . Depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood ( e.g. , delusions that they have sinned , or have contracted serious illness , etc ) . Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into ' ' primary ' ' and ' ' secondary ' ' types . Primary delusions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of normal mental processes , whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person 's background or current situation ( e.g. , ethnicity ; also religious , superstitious , or political beliefs ) . # Catatonia # Catatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired . There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior . The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake . This type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility . Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person 's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional ( such as moving a person 's arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there ) . The other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above . It involves excessive and purposeless motor behavior , as well as extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality . An example is someone walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a level of mental preoccupation ( meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation ) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset . In both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them . It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania , although someone could have both . # Thought disorders # Thought disorder describes an underlying disturbance to conscious thought and is classified largely by its effects on speech and writing . Affected persons show loosening of associations , that is , a disconnection and disorganization of the semantic content of speech and writing . In the severe form speech becomes incomprehensible and it is known as word salad . # Psychiatric disorder # From a diagnostic standpoint , organic disorders were those believed caused by physical illness affecting the brain ( that is , psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions ) , while functional disorders were considered disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders ( that is , primary psychological or psychiatric disorders ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders arise from physical processes ; in this view , the distinction between brain and mind , and therefore between organic and functional disease , is an artificial one . Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional , such as schizophrenia . The DSM-IV-TR avoids the functional/organic distinction , and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses , psychosis due to general medical conditions , and substance-induced psychosis . Primary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following : * schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder * affective ( mood ) disorders , including severe depression , and severe depression or mania in bipolar disorder ( manic depression ) . People experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of depression may experience persecutory or self-blaming delusions or hallucinations , while people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of mania may form grandiose delusions . * schizoaffective disorder , involving symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders * brief psychotic disorder , or acute/transient psychotic disorder * delusional disorder ( persistent delusional disorder ) * chronic hallucinatory psychosis Psychotic symptoms may also be seen in * schizotypal disorder * certain personality disorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schizoid personality disorder , and borderline personality disorder ) * major depressive disorder in its severe form although it is possible and more likely to have severe depression without psychosis * bipolar disorder in severe mania and/or severe depression although it is possible to have severe mania and/or severe depression without psychosis as well , in fact that is more commonly the case * post-traumatic stress disorder * induced delusional disorder * Sometimes in obsessive-compulsive disorder * Dissociative disorders , due to many overlapping symptoms , careful differential diagnosis includes especially dissociative identity disorder . Stress is known to contribute to and trigger psychotic states . A history of psychologically traumatic events , and the recent experience of a stressful event , can both contribute to the development of psychosis . Short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as brief reactive psychosis , and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks . In some rare cases , individuals may remain in a state of full-blown psychosis for many years , or perhaps have attenuated psychotic symptoms ( such as low intensity hallucinations ) present at most times . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any psychiatric disease . Causes or triggers include * Falling asleep and waking : hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations , which are entirely normal * Bereavement , in which hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common * Severe sleep deprivation * Sensory deprivation and sensory impairment * caffeine intoxication * extremely stressful event # Subtypes # Subtypes of psychosis include : * Menstrual psychosis , including circa-mensual ( approximately monthly ) periodicity , in rhythm with the menstrual cycle . * Postpartum psychosis , occurring recently after childbirth * Monothematic delusions * Myxedematous psychosis * Occupational psychosis * Stimulant psychosis * Tardive psychosis * Shared psychosis * Cycloid psychosis # #Cycloid psychosis# # Cycloid psychosis is psychosis that progresses from normal to full-blown usually within a few hours , not related to drug intake or brain injury . In addition , diagnostic criteria include at least four of the following symptoms : * Confusion * Mood-incongruent delusions * Hallucinations * Pan-anxiety , a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances * Happiness or ecstasy of high degree * Motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type * Concern with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what is needed for diagnosis of an affective disorder Cycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 1550 years of age . # Causes # Many causes of schizophrenia are also causes of psychosis. # Medical conditions # A very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis , sometimes called ' ' secondary psychosis ' ' . Examples include : * disorders causing ' ' delirium ' ' ( ' ' toxic psychosis ' ' ) , in which consciousness is disturbed * neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities , including velocardiofacial syndrome * neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer 's disease , dementia with Lewy bodies , and Parkinson 's disease * focal neurological disease , such as stroke , brain tumors , multiple sclerosis , and some forms of epilepsy * malignancy ( typically via masses in the brain , paraneoplastic syndromes , or drugs used to treat cancer ) * infectious and postinfectious syndromes , including infections causing delirium , viral encephalitis , HIV , malaria , Lyme disease , syphilis * endocrine disease , such as hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , adrenal failure , Cushing 's syndrome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes childbirth can provoke psychosis , termed puerperal psychosis * inborn errors of metabolism , such as Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency , porphyria and metachromatic leukodystrophy * nutritional deficiency , such as vitamin B <sub> 12 </sub> deficiency * other acquired metabolic disorders , including electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia , hypernatremia , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , hypermagnesemia , hypercalcemia , and hypophosphatemia , but also hypoglycemia , hypoxia , and failure of the liver or kidneys * autoimmune and related disorders , such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus , SLE ) , sarcoidosis , Hashimoto 's encephalopathy , and anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis * poisoning , by therapeutic drugs ( see below ) , recreational drugs ( see below ) , and a range of plants , fungi , metals , organic compounds , and a few animal toxins *
