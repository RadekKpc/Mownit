Following the introduction of the Euro , Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the Euro to be around 53% , close to the European average . Since the year 2000 , Latvia has had one of the highest ( GDP ) growth rates in Europe . However , the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of the Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009 , exacerbated by the global economic crisis , shortage of credit and huge money resources needed for bailout of Parex bank . Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009 , the biggest fall in the European Union . The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast growing economy was heading for implosion of the economic bubble , because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption , financed by a serious increase of private debt , as well as a negative foreign trade balance .

Latvia 's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22% . In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU , at 22.5% , ahead of Spain , which had 19.7% . Paul Krugman , the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008 , wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008 : : The most acute problems are on Europes periphery , where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia : Latvia is the new Argentina However , by 2010 , commentators noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy .
