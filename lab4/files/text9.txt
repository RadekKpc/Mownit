State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres , in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed . Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions . The resulting people 's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR , which the Soviet Union granted . Latvia , then a puppet government , was headed by Augusts Kirhenteins . The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940 , as The ' ' Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic . ' ' The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents prior to the German invasion , in less than a year , at least 27,586 people were arrested . Most were deported for cooperating with the German army , and about 945 were shot . Under German occupation , Latvia was administered as part of ' ' Reichskommissariat Ostland ' ' . Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well .

In the course of the war , both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies , in this way increasing the loss of the nation 's live resources . In 1944 , part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control . The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system . After the German surrender , it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay , and Latvian national partisans , soon joined by German collaborators , began to fight against the new occupier . Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or , during few months immediately after the end of war , returned by the West . The Soviets reoccupied the country in 19441945 , and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised . On 25 March 1949 , 43,000 rural residents ( kulaks ) and Latvian patriots ( nationalists ) were deported to Siberia in a sweeping Operation Priboi in all three Baltic states , which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949 . An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia , limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language . All of the minority schools ( Jewish , Polish , Belorussian , Estonian , Lithuanian ) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools : Latvian and Russian . An influx of labourers , administrators , military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started . By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists , Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union 's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia . New industry was created in Latvia , including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava , electrotechnical factories in Riga , chemical factories in Daugavpils , Valmiera and Olaineand some food and oil processing plants . Latvia manufactured trains , ships , minibuses , mopeds , telephones , radios and hi-fi systems , electrical and diesel engines , textiles , furniture , clothing , bags and luggage , shoes , musical instruments , home appliances , watches , tools and equipment , aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods . Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory ( LPs ) . However , there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories . To maintain and expand industrial production , skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union , decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic . Population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the 1980s , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika . In the summer of 1987 , the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monumenta symbol of independence . In the summer of 1988 , a national movement , coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia , was opposed by the Interfront . The Latvian SSR , along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy , and in 1988 , the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again , replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990 . In 1989 , the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the ' ' Occupation of the Baltic states ' ' , in which it declared the occupation not in accordance with law , and not the will of the Soviet people .

However , the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991 . In January 1991 , Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions . During the transitional period , Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia . In spite of this , 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991 , in a nonbinding advisory referendum . The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship . However , universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted . A majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship . Many of them were born in Latvia , but still became non-citizens .
